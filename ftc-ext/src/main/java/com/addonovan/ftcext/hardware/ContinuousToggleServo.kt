/**
 * A blend between the [ContinuousServo] and the [ToggleServo]. This
 * inherits from a ContinuousServo, rather than a ToggleServo, because
 * this functions far differently than a normal ToggleServo does.
 *
 * How this functions is a little difficult to understand from the
 * code; however, it is actually quite simple. When a servo is
 * toggled, it will switch to the correct state, and, after
 * [ToggleRunTime] milliseconds, it will stop and be in the end state.
 * For example, if a servo were toggled on, it would run in
 * the direction given by [EngagedDirection] under the status of "Engaging"
 * for [ToggleRunTime] milliseconds, then stop under the status of
 * "Engaged". When it is next toggled, it will run for [ToggleRunTime]
 * milliseconds in the opposite direction of [EngagedDirection] under
 * the status of "Disengaging", then it will stop and have the status
 * of "Disengaged" until it's toggled next.
 *
 * @param[servo]
 *          The servo to create a ContinuousToggleServo from.
